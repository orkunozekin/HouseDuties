Have you ever had a conflict with your household members about who is supposed to do what house duties such as dishes, laundry, vacuuming, etc...?
House Duties was created to fix that conflict for your household by allowing you to create a household account and add each house member to that account, where you can create tasks and assign them to whoever is responsible for that task.
By doing so, your household will be able to keep track of who is responsible for what house duty and what needs to be done by a certain due date.
